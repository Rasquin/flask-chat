# Flask Chat App

This is a chat application written in Flask. The purpose of this project is to take data from a URL and store the information in a list

The idea behind our chat application is that we're going to create these URLs based around usernames.
And when the user puts a chat message up, we'll be able to display that in the browser along with the timestamp.
